## Exercise 5.8

In the text, a variant of the CFB mode is proposed which encrypts individual bytes. Draw a block diagram for this mode when using AES as block cipher. Indicate the width (in bit) of each line in your diagram.

### Solution

*I haven't yet verified this solution independently. If you spot any mistakes, please leave a comment in the Disqus box at the bottom of the page.*

*I haven't had the time to produce the diagram yet, so I will fill this in later.*
