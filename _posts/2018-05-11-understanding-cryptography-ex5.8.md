## Exercise 5.8

In the text, a variant of the CFB mode is proposed which encrypts individual bytes. Draw a block diagram for this mode when using AES as block cipher. Indicate the width (in bit) of each line in your diagram.

### Solution

*I'm not really sure what this "variant of the CFB mode" that's "[i]n the text" actually refers to, so I'm not able to answer this question. If anyone has any input that could shed light on what this question is asking for, please share. To me, it appears to be a duplicate of what was requested for [Ex 5.6](/understanding-cryptography-ex5.6/).*
