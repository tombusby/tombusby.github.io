## Exercise 2.5

We will now analyze a pseudorandom number sequence generated by a LFSR characterized by $$ (c_2 = 1, c_1 = 0, c_0 = 1) $$.

1. What is the sequence generated from the initialization vector $$ (s_2 = 1, s_1 = 0, s_0 = 0) $$?
2. What is the sequence generated from the initialization vector $$ (s_2 = 0, s_1 = 1, s_0 = 1) $$?
3. How are the two sequences related?

### Solution

*This solution is verified as correct by the official [Solutions for Odd-Numbered Questions](http://wiki.crypto.rub.de/Buch/en/download/Understanding_Cryptography_Odd_Solutions.pdf) manual.*

This LFSR can be visualised as such:

![LFSR]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/understanding-crypto/ex2-5-lfsr.png){: .image-center}

1\. The sequence generated by $$ (s_2 = 1, s_1 = 0, s_0 = 0) $$ is as follows:

<div style="text-align: center;">
<script type="math/tex">
\begin{array}{c c c|c}
s_2 & s_1 & s_0 & \text{Output} \\ \hline
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\ \hline
1 & 0 & 0 & 0
\end{array}
</script>
</div>

*Note*: the final row is the same as the first, meaning it will loop infinitely.

2\. The sequence generated by $$ (s_2 = 0, s_1 = 1, s_0 = 1) $$ is as follows:

<div style="text-align: center;">
<script type="math/tex">
\begin{array}{c c c|c}
s_2 & s_1 & s_0 & \text{Output} \\ \hline
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ \hline
0 & 1 & 1 & 1
\end{array}
</script>
</div>

*Note*: the final row is the same as the first, meaning it will loop infinitely.

3\. Since $$ (0, 1, 1) $$ is part of the sequence for $$ (1, 0, 0) $$, its loop is exactly the same, but rotated back by three positions. Both of them give the same loop of states (which contains of all non-zero 3-bit binary numbers), but starting from whatever was chosen to initialise it.
